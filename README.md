# Early-Stage-Brain-Tumor-Detection
This project implements an AI-driven system for early-stage brain tumor detection. It enhances medical images using Real-ESRGAN, extracts features with HOG and PCA, and employs XGBoost for classification. Additionally, it generates synthetic medical images and reports with GPT-2 while maintaining privacy through federated learning.
